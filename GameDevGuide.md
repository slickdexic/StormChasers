## Storm Rules

*Card game based on Prsi, similar to Crazy 8s*

### Card Deck
- **Ranks Used**: 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A (all four suits: hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs)
- **Single Deck**: 32 cards (8 ranks Ã— 4 suits)
- **Game Options**: Single deck (32 cards) or double deck (64 cards)
  - **Two-deck implications**: More uncertainty with additional 7s, Queens, and Aces. Potential for longer rounds.

### Special Card Rules

#### Aces
- **Effect**: Skip the next player's turn

#### Queens
- **Effect**: Wild card that can be played on any card **except** a toxic 7
- **Requirement**: Player must call a suit when playing a Queen (unless the Queen finishes the Storm round)

#### Sevens (Toxic Cards)
- **Effect**: Next player must either:
  - Play another 7, OR
  - Draw 2 cards (plus 2 for each stacked 7)
- **Stacking**: Each 7 played on a toxic 7 adds 2 to the draw requirement
- **Reset**: Once a player draws cards, the 7 is no longer toxic
- **Important**: Any 7 played on a non-toxic 7 creates a new single toxic 7 (draw 2)

### Dealing and Setup

1. **Dealing Order**: Clockwise, starting with the player after the dealer
2. **Cards Per Player**: 3-5 cards (set by host before game)
3. **Initial Setup**:
   - **Deal cards face down to each player**: One card per player at a time, in clockwise order, until each player has the correct number of cards
   - Turn over one card to start the discard pile
   - Place remaining cards as the stock pile

#### Special Initial Card Rules
- **Queen as first card**: Queen calls the suit of the bottom card in the deck
- **7 as first card**: Considered toxic immediately (next player must play 7 or draw 2)

### Gameplay Rules

#### Turn Order
- **First Player**: Player after the dealer (clockwise)
- **Exception**: If first card is an Ace, the first player is skipped

#### Valid Plays
Players must play a card that matches either:
- **Suit** of the top discard card, OR
- **Rank** of the top discard card
- **Exception**: If a Queen changes the suit, the played Queen assumes the called suit

#### Special Situations
- **Toxic 7 Active**: Player can only play another 7 or draw required cards
- **Non-toxic Situations**: Player may play a Queen as wild card and call suit
- **Drawing Rule**: Unlike Crazy 8s, players cannot play immediately after drawing - turn ends

#### Winning and Turn Order
1. **First to empty hand**: Receives "1st" badge
2. **Remaining players**: Continue until all have finishing positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
3. **Two-player endgame**: If a player finishes with a Queen, no suit call needed
4. **Next Storm round**: Dealer button advances clockwise

## Game Flow Overview

### Complete Game Sequence
1. **Dealer Selection Stage** *(Once per game)*
2. **Storm Stage** *(Repeated each round)*
3. **Lane Selection Stage** *(Once per game, after first Storm)*
4. **Coin Stage** *(Repeated each round)*
5. **Racing Stage** *(Repeated each round)*

---

## Detailed Stage Descriptions

### 1. Dealer Selection Stage
*Occurs once at game start*

#### Process
- **Display**: 18 face-down cards in 3 rows of 6 cards (from a randomly shuffled deck)
- **Selection**: Players take turns (by room seat order) selecting one card
- **Dealer Determination**: Player with lowest card becomes dealer (7 low, Ace high)
- **Tie Resolution**: Tied players select again until tie is broken
- **Result**: Selected dealer receives dealer button for first Storm stage

### 2. Storm Stage
*Card game using rules above*

#### Objectives
- First player to discard all cards wins the round
- All players receive finishing order badges (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- Winning order determines turn priority for subsequent stages

### 3. Lane Selection Stage
*Occurs once after first Storm stage*

#### Process
- Players select starting lanes in Storm winning order
- **Track Position**: All players start at position 96 (one of four available pole positions)
- **Interface**: Dashed circles indicate selectable positions
- **Pan & Zoom**: Disabled during lane selection, view zoomed and panned (focused) on position 96
- **Timing**: After lane selection, game proceeds to Coin Stage

### 4. Coin Stage
*Occurs before each Racing Stage*

#### Coin Distribution
Based on previous Storm winning order:
- **1st Place**: N coins (host-configured: 1-3)
- **2nd Place**: N-1 coins (minimum 0)
- **3rd Place**: N-2 coins (minimum 0)
- **4th Place**: 0 coins

#### Coin Placement Rules
- Players place all awarded coins in Storm winning order
- **Restrictions**:
  - No coins in pit or pit-lane areas
  - No coins in 6 spaces directly in front of other players' pawns (grayed out during placement)
- **Process**: Each player places all their coins on their turn

#### Coin Values (90 total coins randomly mixed in coin purse)
- **+2** (16 coins) - Move forward 2 spaces
- **+3** (12 coins) - Move forward 3 spaces  
- **+4** (8 coins) - Move forward 4 spaces
- **+5** (6 coins) - Move forward 5 spaces
- **-2** (16 coins) - Move backward 2 spaces
- **-3** (12 coins) - Move backward 3 spaces
- **-4** (8 coins) - Move backward 4 spaces
- **-5** (6 coins) - Move backward 5 spaces
- **Tow-to-Pit** (6 coins) - Sent to pit (no lap credit)

---

## Racing Mechanics

### Movement Options
Players choose one of two types of dice each turn:

#### Option 1: Movement Die (Standard 6-sided die)
**OR Two Dice** *(If host-configured two-dice game setting is enabled)*

**Movement Rules:**
- Cars cannot be jumped over (they are obstructions)
- Only one car per space
- If obstructed, land on last available space before obstruction
- Pawn moves forward the rolled amount or until obstructed
- **Important**: Pawns travel across spaces until they "land on" a space - coins merely traveled across are not triggered

**Landing on Coins:**
- Coin is revealed and effect applied immediately
- Coin-induced movement follows same obstruction rules
- **Chain reactions**: If coin-induced movement lands on another coin, that coin activates
- **No infinite loops**: Coins are removed from track when triggered
- **No reaction limit**: Chain reactions continue until no more coins are triggered

#### Option 2: Lane-Change Die (6-sided die)
**Directional Reference**: Left = towards inside lane, Right = towards outside lane

**Die Faces:**
- **Face 1**: L1 - Move one lane left (towards inside) if not obstructed by wall or pawn
- **Face 2**: R1 - Move one lane right (towards outside) if not obstructed by wall or pawn
- **Face 3**: Check Engine symbol - Turn ends
- **Face 4**: L2 - Move up to two lanes left (as far as possible, up to two spaces)
- **Face 5**: R2 - Move up to two lanes right (as far as possible, up to two spaces)
- **Face 6**: Check Engine symbol - Turn ends

**Lane Change Rules:**
- Movement blocked by walls or other pawns
- Move as far as possible (up to maximum for roll)
- Lane changes onto pit-lane are possible and permitted
- Landing on pit-lane results in pit-lane rules applying on player's next turn

### Pit System

#### Pit vs. Pit-Lane Distinction
- **Pit**: Starting area when sent there (separate from main track)
- **Pit-Lane**: 5-space corridor for exiting pit back to main track

#### Entering the Pit
**Triggers:**
- Tow-to-Pit coin effect
- Crash into pit-lane end wall (e.g., roll a 6 from the pit)

#### Pit Rules
**From Pit:**
- Must roll one standard die (even if playing with two-dice variant) to advance to pit-lane
- **Pit-lane spaces**: Only 5 available
- **Rolling 6**: Crashes into pit-lane wall, sent back to pit
- **Pit-lane Order**: Entering pit-lane from the pit begins at pit-lane spot 1 which is adjacent to main track Lane 1 position 1

#### Pit-Lane Rules
**Once on pit-lane, in any pit-lane space:**

**Die Choice:**
- Can choose standard die OR lane-change die
- **Restriction**: If space directly to the right is obstructed by a pawn, must use standard die (risk colliding with pit-lane wall)

**Lane-Change Die Results:**
- **R1 or R2**: Can merge onto main track (standard obstruction and coin rules apply)
- **Any other result**: Turn ends

**Standard Die Results:**
- Normal forward movement within pit-lane
- Risk hitting pit-lane wall if roll would exceed available spaces (sent back to pit)

### Race Completion
- **Finish Condition**: Cross finish line on final lap
- **End of Round**: All players complete their racing stage after first finisher
- **Single Winner**: If only one player finishes, they win and game ends
- **Multiple Finishers**: Player who is farthest ahead wins
- **Tie Resolution**: Continue racing (same winning order, no card/coin stages) until one is ahead
